## About
This repository contains a list of some of the most important questions to master Data Structures and Algorithms.The source material for most of the questions is the famous book "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell. It is very important to understand each question right down to the basics and then come up the optimal solution. 
The solutions might not be the most optimal ones, but they are the ones that I could come up with in the first go. I'll be updating once I find a better solution

## Approach
To understand any given solution, the most important part is to understand the question. The questions have been categorised for efficient lookups in the book "Cracking the Coding Interview". Whenever you need any additional information regarding the question(or the solution for that matter), just open the book and search for the question in the given category.

## Note to future self
Find the truth, and I shall meet you there!
